## Description
 Final project for CS417 Introduction to Data Mining. Consists of a lot of conversions, and RF and ANN algorithms.
  
## Models Implemented
  - Random Forest Algorithm for Feature Selection
  - Artificial Neural Network for classification.
  
## How to Use
 Clone the repository to your local machine.
 Download the .csv file from Kaggle and place it in the same folder as the .R file.
 Run everything line by line until you reach the end, the code is made so its plug and use.
